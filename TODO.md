## 🗺️ Overview

The project spans **four engineering domains** that must be developed in parallel with well-defined integration points:

| Domain | Folder | Maturity Target |
|---|---|---|
| Hardware / CAD | `/hardware/cad/` | Fabrication-ready STEP + STL files |
| Software / Control OS | `/software/opencyclo_os/` | Deployable Python daemon (Jetson Nano / RPi 5) |
| Physics / CFD | `/physics/openfoam/` | Validated `kOmegaSST` simulation case |
| Wetware / Protocols | `/wetware/protocols/` | OpenMTA-compliant SOP documents |

Integration milestones are marked **[INT]**.
