# 🌍 Cyclo-Earth: Project Genesis

The ultimate strategic visualization of the OpenCyclo Initiative. This frontend interface bridges individual user experience with global climate dynamics, allowing anyone to tangibly see the difference 1,000,000 decentralized cycloreactors make on atmospheric chemistry.

## 🛠️ The Simulation Stack
- **Browser-Side Climate Physics**: A localized javascript port (`genesis.js`) of Hector/MAGICC equivalent physics. It calculates biochar latency grids and carbon flux (BAU - PSC model variants) dynamically out to the year 2100.
- **The Golden Cross**: An algorithmic visual threshold that celebrates the exact year the Earth hits "Net Zero" based on user inputs.
- **WebGL Interactivity**: Draws tens of thousands of procedural map data points rendering the simulation entirely locally via the `canvas` context without taxing high bandwidth resources.

Project Genesis is the "Why" to the CV-PBR-V1's "How".
