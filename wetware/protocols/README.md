# 🧫 Wetware SOPs

The biological protocol library for operating the OpenCyclo Initiative hardware ecosystem. These manuals are engineered for **anyone**, regardless of formal microbiology degrees, ensuring true planetary scaling.

## 📋 The 100-Series SOPs
1. **`SOP-101_Media_Formulation.md`**: Guides operators through batching, filtering, and UV-C sterilizing agricultural runoff/digestate into usable $N:P:K$ media, including rigorous QC checks.
2. **`SOP-102_Strain_Inoculation.md`**: Procedure for unboxing a UTEX/CCAP agar slant and stepping up the culture incrementally to 50L before inoculating the 1,000L SMU reactor in the `NURSERY` state.
3. **`SOP-103_Turbidostat_Harvesting.md`**: Defines the physical operation of the Hydrocyclone concentrator. It establishes the 15% extraction volume rules dictated by optical density feedback loops.
4. **`SOP-104_Contamination_Biosecurity.md`**: The response mechanism to YOLOv8 anomaly detection and visual cues in the tank. Focuses heavily on the safe execution of **pH Shocks** to eliminate invasive species like rotifers or amoebas without collapsing the *Chlorella*.

## 🧬 Strain Registry
* **`STRAIN_REGISTRY.md`**: Central source of truth tracking which *Chlorella* substrains we deploy based on temperature tolerance and lipid targets.
