**OpenCyclo Engineering Portal**, a dedicated interactive environment for the technical community.

This portal is structured as an **Active Development Environment** where engineers, hackers, and researchers can evaluate the current blueprints, access the open-source registry, and contribute data from their own experiments. It transforms the strategic proposal into a collaborative engineering workflow.

### Key Engineering Modules:

1. **The Blueprints Vault:** Interactive access to the SMU-1000 and Garage Pilot documentation (DOC-03 through DOC-07).
2. **OQ Evaluation Lab:** A peer-review module based on the **Engineering Resolution Protocol (OQ1-OQ8)**, allowing users to analyze fluid dynamic fixes (e.g., the 38mm tangential offset).
3. **Hardware Repository:** Direct integration links to the `OpenCycloInitiative` GitHub, categorized by CAD (.STEP), Firmware (ROS2/Python), and Simulation (OpenFOAM).
4. **CycloTwin SITL Portal:** A software-in-the-loop module for developers to mock hardware inputs and test AI biosecurity models.
5. **Global Hacker Feed:** A space for decentralized pilots to "Complement" the proposal by submitting their growth curve data.

This portal is designed to be the "Engine Room" of your project. It explicitly provides spaces for peer review (Evaluating the OQ protocols) and decentralized data submission (Complementing with Hacker Pilot growth curves), creating a closed-loop engineering feedback system.

**Next Deployment Steps:**

1. **Host this file** via your GCP Firebase Hosting or Cloud Run environment.
2. **Mapping Bounties:** Use the "Evaluation Lab" to list open engineering challenges (e.g., "Refine OQ-08 biosecurity YOLO threshold").
3. **Hacker Pilot Onboarding:** Direct inventors to the "Hacker Lab" to sync their local 19L water-jug nodes with the global mission control.
