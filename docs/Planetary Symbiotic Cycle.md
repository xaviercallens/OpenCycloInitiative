**Planetary Symbiotic Cycle (PSC) Operational Portal**.

This SPA is designed as a **"Call to Action" Dashboard**. It replaces passive reading with active exploration of the **OpenCyclo Initiative** GitHub repository and the specific 12-document framework.

### **Strategic Recommendations Implemented in the SPA:**

1. **Dual-Track Engagement:** Separate paths for "Garage Hackers" (Low cost, high speed) and "Industrial Engineers" (High scale, SMU-1000).
2. **GitHub-First Architecture:** Direct prominence for `xaviercallens/OpenCycloInitiative` with links to CAD (.STEP), CFD (OpenFOAM), and Python code.
3. **Stoichiometric Transparency:** Explicitly featuring the **1.83 kg CO₂ / 1 kg Biomass** constant to establish scientific authority.
4. **Gamified Simulation:** An interactive adoption slider that visualizes the "Reality Sync" between local nodes (like Contes, France) and global impact.

### **Recommendations for Web Site Improvement**

To successfully engage engineers, hackers, and inventors, the website must pivot from a "project overview" to a **"Developer & Builder Documentation"** platform.

#### **1. Structural & UI/UX Improvements**

* **The "Hacker" Path (Low Barrier to Entry):** Create a highly prominent section for the **DOC-07 Garage Pilot**. Most global inventors won't build a 1,000L unit first. They will build the $150 version. Provide a "Shopping List" with Amazon/AliExpress links for the inverted water jug and aquarium hardware.
* **Live Simulation (Reality Sync):** Implement the **Phase 5 (CycloEarth)** concepts directly on the homepage. Use the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to show real-time telemetry from the Alpha Node in Contes, France. Seeing "Live CO₂ Absorption" from a real reactor is the single best way to convince skeptics.
* **Dynamic Document Ledger:** Instead of static PDFs, host the 12 documents as interactive "Notion-style" pages. Engineers prefer searching text over downloading large PDFs.

#### **2. GitHub & Open Source Strategy**

* **Unified Repository:** Point all building traffic to `xaviercallens/OpenCycloInitiative`.
* **Repository Structure:** Organize the repo according to the Phases:
* `/CAD`: .STEP files for the SMU-1000 and the Garage Pilot.
* `/Firmware`: Python/ROS2 code for sensor management.
* `/Sim`: OpenFOAM and NVIDIA Modulus configuration files.


* **Contributing Guide:** Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` that explicitly asks for help with:
* Improving the CFD models (Phase 4).
* Porting the JARVIS HUD (Phase 5) to React/WebGL.
* Validating the biokinetic growth models for different algae strains.



#### **3. Experimentation & Validation Hub**

* **The "Experiment Registry":** Add a section where users can submit their own pilot data. If a hacker in Brazil builds a unit, they should be able to upload their growth curve and CO₂ capture rates to the global simulator.
* **Biological SOPs:** Provide clear "Standard Operating Procedures" (SOPs) for algae cultivation. Most engineers understand the pipes (hardware) but are intimidated by the biology. Simplify the "Bio" part into a step-by-step recipe.

#### **4. Scientific Authority & Citations**

* **The Bibliography Ledger:** Dedicate a section to the scientific proofs (Woolf 2010, Kadam 2001, etc.). Use the "1.83kg Constant" as a recurring theme—it's the mathematical anchor of the entire project.

By following the interactive portal I generated above, the website will shift its tone to **"We have the blueprints, here is the code, now let's build."** This is how you engage the global maker community.
