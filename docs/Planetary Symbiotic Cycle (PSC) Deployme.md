Planetary Symbiotic Cycle (PSC) Deployment Roadmap

1. The GCP "Antigravity" Stack

To engage a global audience of inventors and engineers, the infrastructure must be as fast and "weightless" as the vortex biokinetics we preach.

Component

GCP Service

Objective

Frontend

Firebase Hosting + Cloud Run

Worldwide low-latency access with serverless scaling.

Global Globe

WebGL / Three.js

Real-time 3D visualization of PSC nodes (Project Genesis).

Telemetry

Cloud Pub/Sub

"Reality Sync" linking home-built units to global data.

Twin Engine

Compute Engine (A2 VMs)

Running the CycloTwin (DOC-08) multi-physics models.

Code Hub

GitHub Actions

Automated validation of user-submitted CAD modifications.

2. GitHub Integration Priorities

The OpenCycloInitiative repository should be the "Source of Truth":

Master Registry: Every document from DOC-01 to DOC-12 should be cross-linked to specific code folders (e.g., DOC-04 Construction Manual linked to /CAD/SMU-1000/).

Issues as Tasks: Use GitHub Issues to post specific engineering "Bounties" (e.g., "Optimize sparger shear stress in CFD").

Hacker Piloting: Create a /Hacker-Pilot folder specifically for the $150 V0.1-Alpha build (DOC-07).

3. Communication Strategy

Cinematic Technicality: Use the "Stark Tech" HUD aesthetic. Engineers are attracted to professional-grade documentation and high-fidelity visuals.

Stoichiometric Anchor: Keep the 1.83kg CO₂/kg Biomass constant at the center of all messaging. It is our mathematical signature.
